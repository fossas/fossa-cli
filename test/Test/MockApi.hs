-- | A framework for Mocking API effects for testing
--
-- This system resolves around setting expectations.  An expectation represents a
-- request we expect to be made and the result of that request.  Additionally, the
-- expectation may be that the request is made only once or many times.
--
-- The request must be a @FossaApiClientF@ and must exactly be the request
-- expected.  This is due to some limitations on matching types at run time.
-- Expectations are matched in the order they are set up.  An assertion failure
-- will be raised if a request is made that doesn't have a matching expectation.
--
-- The result can either be a return value or to die with a fatal diagnostic
-- error.
--
-- Set up expectations using the `returnsOnce`, `alwaysReturns` and `fails`
-- helpers.
--
-- @
--     -- Set up basic expectation
--     GetOrganization `alwaysReturns` Fixtures.organization
--     GetProject revision `returnsOnce` Fixtures.project
--
--     -- Expect get issues to be called and fail, then return successfully when
--     -- called again.
--     GetIssues revision `fails` "Mock API error"
--     GetIssues revision `returnsOnce` Fixtures.issues
-- @
--
-- An expectation is considered satisfied if it had a limited number of invocations
-- and it has been matched that many times.  If any expectations are unsatisfied at
-- the end of the test, an test assertion failure will be raised.
