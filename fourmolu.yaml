# The fixity of operators affects how Fourmolu formats them.
# Without this directive, we'd get really wonky corrections that would do things like turn this:
# ```
# exprA && exprB
# ```
# Into
# ```
# expr
#  && exprB
# ``
# For operator heavy code, like Aeson parsers, it would be even worse than this.
# Fourmolu says that it can automatically detect fixities in most cases,
# but I had to specify these manually to get reasonable formatting.
# Docs: https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu#language-extensions-dependencies-and-fixities
# If you have issues with operator formatting, usually you can find the right fixity in the haddocks.
