# Hlint 3.6.1 has a bug where typed TH splices are not recognized so it reports
# TemplateHaskell as an unused pragma: https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint/issues/1531
# A fix is merged, but has not yet been released.
# Remove the ignore directive when this commit makes it into a release and is part of haskell-dev-tools.
