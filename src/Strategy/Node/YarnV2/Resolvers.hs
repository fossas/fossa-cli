-- | Yarn v2 has a handful of default protocols it supports through "Resolvers"
-- in bundled plugins.
--
-- Protocol documentation can be found here: https://yarnpkg.com/features/protocols
--
-- Confusingly, the package examples described on that page are /Descriptors/,
-- not Locators. As such, we don't care to support parsing all of these
-- examples: we only care to parse the Locators produced by the related
-- Resolvers
--
-- See also: default plugins, many of which contain resolvers https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/8afcaa2a954e196d6cd997f8ba506f776df83b1f/packages/yarnpkg-cli/package.json#L68-L82

---------- WorkspaceResolver

workspaceProtocol :: Text
workspaceProtocol = "workspace:"

-- | Resolved workspace locators come in the form @workspace:./relative/reference/to/dir@
--
-- Relative references may contain '..', so they're not quite @Path Rel Dir@
--
-- See: https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/8afcaa2a954e196d6cd997f8ba506f776df83b1f/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/WorkspaceResolver.ts

        Right
          . WorkspacePackage
          . dropPrefix workspaceProtocol
          . locatorReference
    }

---------- NpmResolver

npmProtocol :: Text
npmProtocol = "npm:"

-- | A resolver for packages that come from npm
--
-- As a fun implementation detail, this resolver is split across several
-- "resolvers" in the yarn codebase -- though by the time locators are committed
-- to a yarn lockfile, they're always structured the same way
--
-- ..with one caveat anyway. npm locators are allowed to contain `::selectors`
-- at the end. This is often used for a pinned archive URL from npm:
--
-- @
--     npm:8.0.0::__archiveUrl=https://....
-- @
--
-- ..so when converting to a package, we drop anything after we find a colon.

    }

---------- GitResolver

-- | The git resolver in yarn ALWAYS normalizes and resolves git references the same way:
--
-- @
--     URL#METADATA
--
--     -- e.g.
--
--     https://github.com/foo/bar.git#commit=$COMMITID
--     https://example.com/baz.git#branch=$BRANCH&commit=$COMMITID
-- @
--
-- The metadata (string after #) is a set of key/value pairs, separated by &
--
-- We can always expect to find a commit key, so we use that for the package
--
-- See: https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/packages/plugin-git/sources/GitResolver.ts
gitResolver :: Resolver
gitResolver =
  Resolver
    { resolverName = "GitResolver"
    , resolverSupportsLocator = ("commit=" `Text.isInfixOf`) . locatorReference
    , resolverLocatorToPackage = gitResolverLocatorToPackage
    }

gitResolverLocatorToPackage :: Locator -> Either Text Package
gitResolverLocatorToPackage loc = do
  (url, metadata) <-
    tag ("Invalid git reference: " <> locatorReference loc) $
      splitSingle "#" (locatorReference loc)

  metaMap <-
    tag ("Failed to parse git metadata: " <> metadata) $
      parseGitMetadata metadata

  commit <-
    tag ("Couldn't find commit in git metadata: " <> showT metaMap) $
      Map.lookup "commit" metaMap

  Right $ GitPackage url commit

tag :: a -> Maybe b -> Either a b
tag a = maybe (Left a) Right

-- | Text.splitOn, but only expects to split once
splitSingle :: Text -> Text -> Maybe (Text, Text)
splitSingle needle txt =
  case Text.splitOn needle txt of
    [a, b] -> pure (a, b)

---------- TarResolver

type Parser = Parsec Void Text

matchParser :: Parser a -> Text -> Bool
matchParser p = either (const False) (const True) . runParser p ""

-- | For a locator to be a valid tar, it must match both of these regexes:
--
-- @
--     export const TARBALL_REGEXP = /^[^?]*\.(?:tar\.gz|tgz)(?:\?.*)?$/;
--     export const PROTOCOL_REGEXP = /^https?:/;
-- @
tarMatchP :: Parser ()
tarMatchP = do
  _ <- chunk "https:" <|> chunk "http:"
  lookForExtension
  _ <- optional (single '?' *> takeRest)

  where
    lookForExtension = do
      _ <- takeWhileP Nothing (\c -> c /= '?' && c /= '.')
      found <- optional $ chunk ".tar.gz" <|> chunk ".tgz"
      case found of
        -- if takeWhileP stopped at a '.', we can continue. '?' is still disallowed
        Nothing -> single '.' *> lookForExtension
        Just _ -> pure ()

-- | The tar resolver supports http/https URLs that point to a tarball (.tar.gz/.tgz)
--
-- See: https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/packages/plugin-http/sources/TarballHttpResolver.ts
tarResolver :: Resolver
tarResolver =
  Resolver
    { resolverName = "TarResolver"
    , resolverSupportsLocator = matchParser tarMatchP . locatorReference
    , resolverLocatorToPackage = Right . TarPackage . locatorReference
    }

---------- Unsupported (by fossa) resolvers

-- | The file resolver supports local "file:" references on disk
fileResolver :: Resolver
fileResolver = unsupportedResolver "FileResolver" "file:" FilePackage

-- | The link resolver is similar to the file resolver
--
-- FOSSA cannot handle these, so we don't do any further parsing of the
-- resolution field
linkResolver :: Resolver
linkResolver = unsupportedResolver "LinkResolver" "link:" LinkPackage

-- | The portal resolver is similar to the link resolver
--
-- FOSSA cannot handle these, so we don't do any further parsing of the
-- resolution field
portalResolver :: Resolver
portalResolver = unsupportedResolver "PortalResolver" "portal:" PortalPackage

-- | The exec resolver allows you to point to a script to run; the output of the
-- script is used as a package
--
-- FOSSA cannot handle these, so we don't do any further parsing of the
-- resolution field
execResolver :: Resolver
execResolver = unsupportedResolver "ExecResolver" "exec:" ExecPackage

-- | The lib resolver is a custom implementation of the portal protocol
--
-- FOSSA cannot handle these, so we don't do any further parsing of the
-- resolution field
libResolver :: Resolver
libResolver = unsupportedResolver "LibResolver" "lib:" LibPackage

-- | The patch resolver allows you to modify another package with patch files.
-- The packages appear elsewhere in the lockfile, so we don't do any further
-- processing of the resolution field
patchResolver :: Resolver
patchResolver = unsupportedResolver "PatchResolver" "patch:" PatchPackage

unsupportedResolver :: Text -> Text -> (Text -> Package) -> Resolver
unsupportedResolver name protocol constructor =
  Resolver
    { resolverName = name
    , resolverSupportsLocator = (protocol `Text.isPrefixOf`) . locatorReference
    , resolverLocatorToPackage = Right . constructor . dropPrefix protocol . locatorReference
