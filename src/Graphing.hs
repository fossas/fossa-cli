-- | A graph (Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap) augmented with the notion of "direct" vertices.
--
-- Graphings can be built with the 'direct', 'edge', 'deep', 'directs', ... primitives.
--
-- For simple (non-cyclic) graphs, try 'unfold'. For graphs with only direct dependencies, try 'fromList'
--
-- Most commonly, Graphings are built by combining sub-graphs with (<>), e.g.,
--
-- @
--     myCoolGraph = directs myListOfDirectNodes <> edges myListOfEdges
-- @
--
-- For describing complex graphs, see the 'Effect.Grapher' effect.
