-- | filterIsVSIOnly is a very naive check for whether the user provided a filter for the VSI target *only*, at the root of the project with no path specified.
-- This decision was made because predicating VSI only scans is a stopgap until we have more broad support for *preemptive* analysis filtering.
-- VSI supports very large scans that the rest of our analysis may not.
