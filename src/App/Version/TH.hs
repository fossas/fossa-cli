{- We'd like to use this time to make sure we have tags when we build release
    versions.  However, 2 things make that difficult at the time of writing:

    * We don't know if we're in a GH PR or a Release build.
    * We only build releases by pushing tags, so we can't even trigger the error case

    For these reasons, we're ignoring the case where there is no tag.  Future enhancements
    should apply to the [] case of the filterTags function below.  Theoretically, we COULD
    do some IO to determine something about github, and execute using `runIO`.
