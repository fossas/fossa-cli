# # fossa-deps file for fossa-cli
# # ------------------------------
# # With the fossa-deps file, you can **manually** include
# # dependencies, stub dependencies that cannot be **automatically**
# # discovered with the `fossa analyze` command.
# #
# # Dependencies denoted in this file will be automatically
# # included with dependencies discovered from the `fossa analyze` command.
# # Any dependencies originating from `fossa-deps` will be shown as a direct
# # dependency in FOSSA.

# # fork-aliases
# # --
# # Denotes mapping of fork dependencies to their base dependencies. When a dependency
# # matches a fork alias (by type and name, ignoring version), it is replaced with

# # a dependency and want it to be treated as the original dependency in FOSSA.
