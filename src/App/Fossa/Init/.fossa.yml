# # See walkthough for example usage: https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/walkthroughs/analysis-target-configuration.md
# targets:
#   # The list of only targets that should be scanned. When used alongside paths.only, 
#   # the intersection of the two lists is taken to find targets for scanning.
#   only:
#     - type: maven
#       path: foo/bar
#
#   # The list of exclude targets which should be excluded from scanning. 
#   # The targets listed in the exclude section will override the targets listed in the only

# # Paths Configuration
# # Filtering section to specify which paths should be scanned or excluded.

# paths:
#   # The list of paths to only allow scanning within.
#   # This section is most commonly used when you would like to restrict scanning 
#   # to a certain list of directories from the root of your project.
#   only:
#     - ./production
#
#   # The list of paths to exclude from scanning in your directory.
#   # This section is intended to be used as the inverse to paths.only.

#     - ./vendor/django/test
