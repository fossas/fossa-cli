-- | @timeout' duration act@ will allow internal cancellation functions to be
-- used, by passing a cancellation token ('Cancel') to act.
-- A negative duration is the same as no time, and will set the cancel flag
-- almost immediately.
--
-- The intended usage is:
-- @
-- timeout' duration $ \cancelToken -> do
--   longRunningComputation cancelFlag
-- @
--
-- Which will run @longRunningComputation@ until it returns, and set the cancel
-- flag after the duration expires.  For a cancellation to occur,
-- @longRunningComputation@ must return a value early by checking the cancel
-- flag with 'checkForCancel'.  If @longRunningComputation@ does not check the
-- cancel flag, or doesn't return early when the flag is set, no timeout will
-- occur.
