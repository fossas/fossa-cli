## v3.8.17

Integrates FOSSA snippet scanning into the main application.
For more details and a quick start guide, see [the subcommand reference](./docs/references/subcommands/snippets.md).

## v3.8.16

Delivers another update to the `millhone` early preview of FOSSA snippet scanning:

- Fixes surprising semantics in some subcommands, especially `commit`.
- Sorts and makes unique dependencies written to `fossa-deps` files.
- Overly noisy snippets are filtered entirely.
- Adds C++ snippet parsing.
- Reduces config and logging verbosity.

## v3.8.15

This version is a special release: it does not alter anything in FOSSA CLI, but instead adds `millhone`,
the new snippet scanning functionality for FOSSA, as a release asset.

Future releases will bundle this functionality into FOSSA CLI instead,
but we're making this CLI available standalone for now to enable immediate use!

Initial documentation for this functionality is here.
When we integrate this functionality into FOSSA CLI itself we'll have improved documentation as well.

Note: FOSSA is still ingesting sources into the snippet scanning database;


## v3.8.14

_Notice:_

- Now, container scanning analyzes projects for applications (`npm`, `pip`, etc) dependencies.
- Now, container scanning can filter specific targets via target exclusions using [fossa configuration file](./docs/references/files/fossa-yml.md).
- Now, `fossa-cli`'s windows binary can perform container scanning.
- Now, container scanned projects will show origin path in FOSSA web UI.
- Now, container scanned projects can target specific architecture via digest.

You can use `--only-system-deps` flag to only scan for dependencies from `apk`, `dpkg`, `dpm`.
This will mimic behavior of older FOSSA CLI's container scanning (older than v3.5.0).

## Version 0 Changelog

We generally follow semantic versioning, but semantic versioning does not
specify pre-1.0.0 behavior. Here is how `fossa` <1.0.0 releases work:

- Any update that creates a breaking change (i.e. a change that causes a
  previously working configuration to fail) will bump the minor version.
- All other updates will bump the patch version.
- Preview, beta, and other special releases will have a pre-release identifer in
  the semantic version, and will be marked as pre-release on GitHub Releases.
