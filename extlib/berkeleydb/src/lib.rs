//! Parse the BerkeleyDB container format.
//!
//! # Logic decisions
//!
//! This library is heavily based on `go-rpmdb`: https://github.com/jssblck/go-rpmdb/blob/956701287363101ee9ade742d6bf1d5c5495f62a/pkg/bdb/bdb.go
//! (I forked this to make some minor modifications for testing).
//! For the most part this library is a direct port with some modification to fit our use case.
//!
//! In turn, that library primarily uses the C implementation for guidance.
//! The `go-rpmdb` library then makes some logic choices (such as which page types are ignored)
//! which we've simply accepted and ported, as they generally didn't include context on _why_ those decisions were made.
//!
//! # Parsers
//!
//! The Go implementation uses the Go `encoding/binary` package to read bytes directly into structs.
//! Rather than try to reimplement the nuances of that library (most of which are Go specific),
//! this library uses simple readers to read bytes directly into the types required for the struct.
