### License scanning local dependencies

FOSSA offers the ability to license scan your code directly. This is used primarily if a package manager is not yet supported or if you are vendoring dependencies. Using the license scanning feature will allow you to capture the licenses for dependencies that may otherwise be missed from normal fossa analysis that relies on package manager information.

In order to specify a file path, modify your `fossa-deps.yml` file and add a `vendored-dependencies` section like the following:

```yml
# Example full `fossa-deps.yaml` file.
referenced-dependencies:
- type: gem
  name: rubyXL
  version: "3.4.16"

vendored-dependencies:
- name: Django
  path: vendor/Django-3.4.16.zip # path can be either a file or a folder.
  version: "3.4.16" # revision will be set to the MD5 hash of the filepath if left unspecified.
```

The path to a vendored dependency can either be a path to an archive or a path to a directory.

If it is a path to an archive, then we recursively unarchive and scan the archive. If it is a directory, then we scan the directory and recursively unarchive and scan any archives contained in the directory.

If the version is not specified, FOSSA CLI calculates the version by generating a hash of the contents of the archive or directory. This is often desired, as it means that the version automatically changes when the contents of the vendored dependency change. It also avoids conflicts across an organization when two different projects contain a vendored dependency with the same name and version, as described in [Vendored Dependency Names and Scope](#vendored-dependency-names-and-scope).

Note: When parsed, YAML considers text that could be a decimal number (such as 1.0 or 2.0) to be a number, not a string. This means that we'd parse the version 1.0 as 1. This probably isn't what you want. To avoid this, surround your version with quotes, as in "1.0".

We also support json-formatted dependencies:

```json
{
  "referenced-dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "gem",
      "name": "iron"
    }, {
      "type": "pypi",
      "name": "Django",
      "version": "2.1.7"
    }
  ],
  "custom-dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "foo",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "license": "MIT"
    }, {
      "name": "foo-wrapper",
      "version": "1.0.2",
      "license": "MIT or Apache-2.0",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Provides a help wrapper for foo-related tasks",
        "homepage": "https://foo-project.org/homepage"
      }
    }
  ],
  "vendored-dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "lodash",
      "path": "lodash-4.17.21"
    }, {
      "name": "winston",
      "path": "vendor/winston.tar.gz",
      "version": "5.0.0-alpha"
    }
  ],
  "remote-dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "foo-url",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "url": "www.foo.tar.gz",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "foo archive",
        "homepage": "https://foo-url.org/homepage"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Vendored Dependency Names and Scope

The name of a vendored dependency is scoped to an organization.

This means that if two different projects in an organization have the same name and version, they are treated as the same dependency by FOSSA, and the one that was scanned first is reported. As an example:

Project A defines a vendored dependency like this in its fossa-deps.yml, and the contents of that vendored dependency contain an MIT license:

```yaml
vendored-dependencies:
- name: Django
  path: vendor/Django-3.4.16.zip
  version: "3.4.16"
```

Project B has exactly the same contents in fossa-deps.yml, but the contents of Project B's vendored dependency contain an Apache 2.0 license.

If Project A is scanned first, then both Project A and Project B report that their vendored dependency has an MIT license.

If Project B is scanned first, then both Project A and Project B report that their vendored dependency has an Apache 2.0 license.

This can cause unexpected behavior. (Note: FOSSA is working on changing this so that vendored dependencies are scoped to projects rather than organizations.)

The suggested workaround is to not set a version in the vendored dependency entry. When the version is omitted, FOSSA calculates a version based on the contents of the vendored dependency, thus avoiding any conflicts. This also has the added benefit of automatically changing the version when the contents of the vendored dependency change.


## How Vendored Dependencies are scanned

There are two methods of vendored dependency scanning: "CLI license scan" and "archive upload".

The default is typically "CLI license scan", but your organization may have opted to default to "archive upload".

Both methods use the same license scanning technology and will give you the same results. The difference is where the license scan is done.

A "CLI license scan" inspects your code for licensing on the local system within the CLI, and only uploads the matched license data to FOSSA's servers.

"Archive upload" uploads the files at the specified path to a secure S3 bucket. We license scan the uploaded files on our servers. All files that do not contain licenses are then removed after 30 days.

You can change the scan method by using the `--force-vendored-dependency-scan-method` flag when invoking the CLI, or by setting the `vendoredDependencies.scanMethod` field in your `.fossa.yml` file. See the [.fossa.yml documentation](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/blob/master/docs/references/files/fossa-yml.md) for details.

## Performance

The FOSSA service caches the results of a vendored dependency by the combination of its `(name, version)` fields.
Due to this caching setup, it is normal for the first analysis to take some time, especially for larger projects, but future analysis of dependencies with the same information should be fast.

If `version` is not specified, FOSSA computes a version based on the contents specified by `path`; this means that if the contents have not changed then the results are reused.

In the event caching is causing problems, FOSSA can be made to rescan this kind of dependency: 
- Run `fossa analyze` with the `--force-vendored-dependency-rescans` flag, or
- Set `vendoredDependencies.forceRescans` to `true` in `.fossa.yml` at the root of the project.
