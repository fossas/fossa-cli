## Fields
### `version:`
Specifies the current fossa configuration file version being used.
### `cli:`
#### `server:`
Primary endpoint that the cli sends its requests to. This field only needs to be modified when running an on-premise or local instance of `fossa.com`.

#### `fetcher:` (Optional)
Describes the type of project fossa is uploading, there are two options:
- `custom` - ?????????????
- `git` (deprecated??) - A unique project on Github

Default: `custom`

#### `project:`
This is the name of the project which will be used to construct a project locator which uniquely identifies a project on the fossa projects page. Keeping this name consistent ensures that all future analysis run is correlated to the same project.

#### `api_key:` (Optional)
Holds a unique Fossa API Key which is used to send uploads to the correct organization. 
We reccomended not including this field to avoid committing a Fossa API key to a repository. Keeping your API Key as an environment variable is a safer approach.

Default: Environment variable `FOSSA_API_KEY` will be used.

#### `revision:` (Optional)
Manually specify a projects revision.

Default: Revision will be obtained from the version control software (VCS) in the project.

#### `locator:` (Optional)
This allows you to manually specify a project locator

Default: locator is created using fetcher, api_key, project, and revision.

### `analyze:`
#### `modules:`
Array of modules to be analyzed in the order they are listed.
#### `name:`
Name of the module being analyzed. This field has no implication on analysis and is for organizational and debugging purposes only.
#### `type:`
Type of module being analyzed, list of supported modules corresponds closely with the [supported languages list](../README.md#SupportedLanguages).

If type is set to `archive`, fossa will upload a copy of all source code inside the folder and run a full license scan on all files.
#### `target:`
Build target for the specified module. 
#### `path:`
Path to the root of the project folder.
#### `option:` (Optional)
Most options are unique to the type of module being analyzed. Refer to the [supported languages' pages](../README.md#SupportedLanguages) for documentation on the full list of options available.

Default: No options.
