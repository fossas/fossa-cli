Maven projects are notoriously difficult to resolve into final dependency
graphs. While many dependencies are declared as XML, these dependency
declarations can span many buildscripts and user settings files. What's worse:
maven plugins are often used to apply dependencies to the project, and some
maven plugins allow arbitrary executable code -- similar to gradle.

To work around this, we're using the maven cli in conjunction with the [depgraph
maven plugin](https://github.com/ferstl/depgraph-maven-plugin), version 4.0.1.
This plugin is used by some Jenkins and Apache open source projects. We also maintain support for version 3.3.0 which support JDK 7.

## Project Discovery

Find `pom.xml` files, and treat those as maven projects. Skip all subdirectories.

## Analysis

1. unpack the embedded plugin to a temporary directory
2. install it to the local maven repository `mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.github.ferstl -DartifactId=depgraph-maven-plugin -Dversion=4.0.1 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=<location>/depgraph-maven-plugin-4.0.1.jar`
3. invoke the plugin in the top-level project with the command `mvn com.github.ferstl:depgraph-maven-plugin:4.0.1:aggregate -DgraphFormat=text -DmergeScopes -DreduceEdges=false -DshowVersions=true -DshowGroupIds=true -DshowOptional=true -DrepeatTransitiveDependenciesInTextGraph=true`

For `graphFormat`s other than `text` the data will be output to
`target/dependency-graph.<format>`. For `text`, it will additionally be output
to stdout.

During this analysis we will attempt to determine what submodules are part of the
this project using the command `mvn com.github.ferstl:depgraph-maven-plugin:4.0.1:reactor -Dgraphformat=json -DoutputFilename=fossa-reactor-graph.json`. We then generate a graph that excludes all of those submodules, but with
their imediate deps marked as direct. This is because we don't want to include the users' projects in graphs, but
do want to be able to analyze the things that they depend on.

For example:

```
org:submodule1:1.0.0:compile
\- org2:pkg1:1.0.0:compile
   +- org2:pkg2:1.0.0:compile
   \- org:submodule2:1.0.0:compile
      \- org3:pkg3:1.0.0:compile
```

If `submodule1` and `submodule2` are both submodules of the project we would
report `pkg3` and `pkg1` as direct dependencies. `pkg2` is reported as a deep
dependency. `submodule1` and `submodule2` won't be included at all. `fossa-cli`'s
graph would look like this:

```
org2:pkg1:1.0.0:compile
\- org2:pkg2:1.0.0:compile

org3:pkg3:1.0.0:compile
```
