# Pnpm

[Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a fast, disk space-efficient package manager. 
Unlike npm and yarn, pnpm uses symbolic links to create a nested structure
of dependencies.

## Project Discovery

Find files named `pnpm-lock.yaml` with a corresponding `package.json` file.

## Analysis

Only `pnpm-lock.yaml` is used for analysis. CLI will parse and use the following fields.
in `pnpm-lock.yaml` to analyze the dependency graph.

- `importers`
  - `[importersKey]`
    - `dependencies`: list of direct dependencies
    - `devDependencies`: list of development dependencies

- `packages`
  - `[packagesKey]`
    - `resolution`: infer git URL, git commit, or package source URL.  
    - `dependencies`: list of transitive dependencies 
    - `peerDependencies`: list of peer dependencies (will be treated like any other dependency)
    - `dev`: to infer if this is used dependency or not. If the value is `true` by default CLI will not include this in the final analysis.

An example is provided below:

```

* If the dependency was resolved using git (`resolution` will have `type: git` attribute),
FOSSA will use provided `repo` and `commit` attribute to analyze this dependency.

```yaml
    # FOSSA will use `commit` and `repo` to analyze the this dependency.
    github.com/Marak/colors.js/6bc50e79eeaa1d87369bb3e7e608ebed18c5cf26:
      resolution: {commit: 6bc50e79eeaa1d87369bb3e7e608ebed18c5cf26, repo: git+ssh://git@github.com/Marak/colors.js, type: git}
      name: colors
      version: 1.4.44-liberty-2
      engines: {node: '>=0.1.90'}
      dev: false
```

* If the dependency was resolved using tarball (`resolution` will have `tarball` attribute) 
FOSSA will use provided URL address to download and analyze this dependency.

```yaml
    # FOSSA will analyze lodash from the tarball URL.
    '@some-url/pkg.tar.gz':
        resolution: {tarball: https://some-url/pkg.tar.gz}
        name: some-pkg
        version: 1.0.0
        engines: {node: '>=4.0.0'}
        dev: false
```

* If the dependency was resolved using the local directory (`resolution` will have the `type: directory` attribute),
FOSSA will not analyze this dependency. Local dependency's transitive dependencies will be analyzed, 
and they will be promoted in place of local dependency. 

```yaml
    # FOSSA will not analyze this dependency, 
    # But FOSSA will analyze its transitive dependency (if they are not sourced from the local directory)
    #
    # FOSSA will promote loose-envify of 1.4.0 in place of unifier.
    file:../libs/my-local-pkg:
        resolution: {directory: "../libs/my-local-pkg", type: directory}
        name: unifier
        version: 1.0.0
        dependencies:
            loose-envify: 1.4.0
        engines: {node: '>=4.0.0'}
        dev: false
```

* If the dependency was resolved using registry resolver, FOSSA will use the registry to analyze the dependency. 
CLI will infer the package name and version using `/${dependencyName}/${dependencyVersion}` scheme from the package's key.

```yaml
    # Resolves to npm dependency: commander with 9.2.0 version
    /commander/9.2.0:
        resolution: {integrity: sha512-e2i4wANQiSXgnrBlIatyHtP1odfUp0BbV5Y5nEGbxtIrStkEOAAzCUirvLBNXHLr7kwLvJl6V+4V3XV9x7Wd9w==}
        engines: {node: ^12.20.0 || >=14}
        dev: false
```

* Peer dependencies will be included in the analysis (they are treated like any other dependency).
* Pnpm workspaces are supported.
* Development dependencies (`dev: true`) are ignored by default from analysis. To include them in the analysis, execute CLI with `--include-unused` flag e.g. `fossa analyze --include-unused`.
* Optional dependencies are included in the analysis by default. They can be ignored in FOSSA UI.
* `fossa-cli` supports lockFileVersion: 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x.


# F.A.Q

### How do I perform analysis only for pnpm projects?

You can explicitly specify an analysis target in `.fossa.yml` file. The example below will exclude all analysis targets except for pnpm.

```yaml
# .fossa.yml 

version: 3
targets:
  only:
    - type: pnpm
```
