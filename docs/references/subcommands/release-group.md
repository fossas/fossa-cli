### F.A.Q.

1. Why are `.fossa.yml` configurations disabled for `fossa release-group delete` and `fossa release-group delete-release`?

This is done intentionally so that lingering configurations in `.fossa.yml` are not extracted and used to mistakenly delete release groups or release group releases.

2. Where can I find my release groups? 

[Release groups](https://app.fossa.com/release-groups) can be found in the UI on the `Release Groups` page.

4. Where can I find my project locator?

The project locator defines a unique ID that the FOSSA API will use to reference a project. The project locator can be found in the UI on the project `Settings` page listed as the `Project Locator` underneath the `Project Title` setting.
