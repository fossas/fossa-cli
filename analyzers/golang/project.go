// A Project is a single folder that forms a coherent "project" for a developer
// and is versioned as a single unit. It may contain multiple Go packages.
type Project struct {
	Tool       resolver.Type // Name of the dependency management tool used by the project, if any.
	Manifest   string        // Absolute path to the tool's manifest file for this project, if any.
	Dir        string        // Absolute path of the first-party code folder, if any.
	ImportPath string        // Import path prefix of project code.
}

// Project calculates the project containing any Go package.
//
// This function searches upwards from the Go package's directory, looking for
// lockfiles of supported dependency management tools. If none are found, it
// fails.
//
// The rationale for this design is that the packages in a "project" are
// versioned together. There are two reasonable ways to capture the notion of
// "versioned together":
//
//   1. The nearest lockfile. The nearest lockfile to the package probably locks
//      the dependencies of the package.
//   2. The nearest VCS repository. The nearest VCS repository probably contains
//      the current "project" being worked on. The only common exception to this
//      is monorepos, in which case all the contents of the repository are
//      probably internal, so allowing packages within the repository to be
//      unresolved is probably acceptable.
//
// There are a couple issues with both of these:
//
//   1. The nearest lockfile is not guaranteed to exist. When it does, it's not
//      guaranteed to be _the_ semantic lockfile for the package -- this is
//      merely a very common convention, not a requirement.
//   2. The package is not guaranteed to be in a VCS repository. When it is, the
//      repository might be extremely weird. One example of this is a repository
//      containing the entire $GOPATH (which is a reasonable convention that
//      some early adopters of Go used).
//
// This function tries its best to mitigate both of these issues:
//
//   1. The nearest lockfile is used for resolving versions. This is a very
//      strong convention.
//   2. The nearest VCS repository is used for determining allowed unresolved
//      import paths. This is also a very strong convention.
//
// Both of these assumptions can be overridden by the user.
